Your payment card information is stored by the Payment Provider, not by Quigley Oats, LLC or any of its properties.</p>
<p><strong>3.4</strong> If you elect to be an Originator and wish to receive payment of Subscriptions from members of the opposite sex, you will need to include additional information on your Member Account by filling out the &lsquo;Subscription Program&rsquo; form on your Private Profile. The form asks for you to upload a recent scan of a valid form of government issued ID (driver&rsquo;s license, state ID, U.S. passport), your Social Security Number (necessary for end-of-the-year income reporting to the IRS), a current, valid email address, as well as a valid and verifiable physical or mailing address so we can email or mail you a Form 1099. &nbsp;Any amounts due to you as an Originator from Quigley Oats, LLC will be paid to you by depositing your earned subscription fees into your personal Q/Account. You will be able to withdraw those funds as soon as they appear in your Q/Account, and you may set up a way to transfer those funds from your Q/Account into your bank account.

<ol start="4">
<li><strong> Subscriptions, Purchases and Payment of Revenue</strong><br /><strong>4.1</strong> Quigley Oats, LLC will procure from Subscribers the Subscription fees agreed to, and will pay Originators 80% of those fees, with 20% management and service fee withheld by Quigley Oats, LLC.

</ol>
<p><strong>4.2</strong> In order to view content in a Private Vault of a member of the opposite sex, you must first click the 'Subscribe' button on the Originator&rsquo;s relevant vault profile, at which point you will be taken to the Subscriber&rsquo;s Payment Page where you must choose a payment provider. Click on that provider&rsquo;s link. Enter your payment card of choice, and when prompted to do so, permit that payment provider to save it as your default payment method for the future. &nbsp;That will add that payment card to your Account with that payment provider. &nbsp;Your payment card details will be maintained confidentially by that Payment Provider which will take payment from your payment card&nbsp;and pay it into a Quigley account.</p>
<p><strong>4.3</strong> The Payment Provider will automatically take monthly payments for subscriptions until you cancel. You may cancel at any time by clicking &lsquo;Stop my subscription&rsquo; in the relevant private vault. &nbsp;You can turn off the 'Auto-Renew' switch located under the relevant Originator&rsquo;s Member Content profile or by contacting Quigley Oats, LLC at support@Quigley Shores.com. If you cancel your monthly payments you will continue to be permitted to view the Originator's Member Content until the end of the existing billing period, after which no further payments will be taken from your payment card and you will no longer be able to view the relevant Originator&rsquo;s private content. You may renew that subscription at any time.</p>
<p><strong>4.4</strong> Quigley Oats, LLC receives the Revenue and holds the Commission on behalf of the relevant Originator, and not on behalf of you, as a Member. Once Quigley Oats, LLC has received payment from you as a Subscriber you have no further liability to the relevant Originator and the Originator shall allow you as a Subscriber to view that Member&rsquo;s Content.</p>
<p><strong>4.5</strong> Quigley Oats, LLC will take payment of the Revenue from the Subscriber and hold the Commission as the agent for the Originator only long enough to confirm payment from you the Subscriber, and then transfer the Originator&rsquo;s share to his or her Q/Account.</p>
<p><strong>4.6</strong> All payments to view Member Content or utilize Subscriber Interactions are final and non-refundable unless the Member terminates a connection to you by &lsquo;blocking&rsquo; you within 10-days of the date you subscribed. &nbsp;If Quigley Oats, LLC is alerted that a Subscriber has sought and received a Refund or Chargeback, then that Subscriber&rsquo;s access to the relevant private vault will terminate, and Quigley Oats, LLC may take additional actions at our sole discretion. &nbsp;Any purchase of the right to view Member Content or to use Subscriber Interaction which is subsequently subject to a Refund or Chargeback may result in the User&rsquo;s account being immediately and permanently terminated from any and all Quigley properties. The Refund or Chargeback amount will also be removed from the earning Originator's income. The Originator may be alerted to the Subscriber Refund or Chargeback.<br /><br /><strong>5.

Account Deactivation</strong><br /><strong>6.1</strong> Should you wish to deactivate your Quigley Shores membership then you may do so through your My Profile section in your Profile.</p>
<p><strong>6.2</strong> If you are a Subscriber, then any account deactivation will take place when your latest subscription term ends, or when your Membership term ends, whichever comes first. You will no longer be charged or have access to Originator Content or Subscriber Interaction when your Account closes. Any subscriptions will end for each Originator when an Account is terminated.</p>
<p><strong>6.3</strong> If you are an Originator then you can only deactivate your membership when your last Subscriber Subscription has expired, whichever is latest, and you have withdrawn any balance on your account.</p>
<p><strong>6.4</strong> If a Member is both an Originator and a Subscriber then the account will be deactivated in two stages (first as a Subscriber, and then as an Originator).</p>
<p><strong>6.5</strong> You will receive an email confirmation upon the successful deletion of your account.&nbsp;<br /><br /><strong>7. Intellectual Property Rights</strong><br /><strong>7.1</strong> <strong>Content</strong></p>
